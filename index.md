## About Me
<br>
I'm a Data Science Master's Student, currently pursuing a degree from Willamette University. I want to use my analytical skills to work for a company which shares my ideals, fighting climate change or working directly to improve the lives of others. I'm interested in the ways we can use data to explore our world and find patterns to help us better understand the trends that explain our lives. <br><br>
I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in 2021 with a degree in Mathematics. After graduating, I worked as a semiconductor manufacturing technician for Intel, before starting my secondary education at Willamette.<br><br>

## Projects
<br>
[Traffic and Weather Project](/pdf/traffic_weather.pdf) <br><br>
For this project, we looked at the relationship between traffic and weather patterns in Portland, Oregon, and San Francisco, California. The project was mainly focused on the Data Engineering aspects, where we employed web scraping using Railway.app, Data cleaning and transformation using the star schema model in PostgreSQL, and exportation for analysis in other tools such as R and Python. I focused on the traffic side of things, pulling data from the TomTom traffic API. A serving API was created to allow users to pull information from the created dataset. Attached are presentation slides showcasing the outline of our process.<br><br>

[Hotel Machine Learning Analysis](/pdf/MLHotel.pdf)
This project was a machine learning analysis of a hotel customer dataset. Data included 19 columns, some continuous and some discrete, where we predicted whether or not the customer will cancel their reservation. We used multiple machine learning techniques including random forest models, logistic regression, transformers, pipelines, feature selectors, hyperparameter optimization, cluster analysis, and PCA analysis. This was conducted in Python using the Sci-kit learn library.

[Kickstarter Statistical Analysis Project](/pdf/kickstarter.pdf)
A statistical analysis on an existing dataset involving over 500000 Kickstarter projects published on the website. Mainly focused on the statistical analysis side, I utilized hypothesis testing including one and two proportion z-tests, residual analysis, time series analysis, and EDA. I explored project category differences, project launch windows and their success rates, and amounts pledged per backer. This project was conducted in R using the tidyverse package.

[Nigeria Sustainability Project](/pdf/NigeriaMarkdown.pdf)
This data modeling and visualization project gave a well rounded analysis on Nigeria's current energy offerings, and the potential of the country in shifting to renewable sources. Involved cleaning and transformation of existing dataset, and communicating findings with a non-technical audience. Created in R using the tidyverse package.
